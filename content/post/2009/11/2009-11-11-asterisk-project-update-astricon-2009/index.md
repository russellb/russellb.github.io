We have a nice blog set up over at [blogs.asterisk.org](http://blogs.asterisk.org/) now, so I will most likely start doing most of my Asterisk blogging over there.

I just posted a blog post version of the Asterisk Project Update presentation that I did at Astricon. Check it out [here](http://blogs.asterisk.org/2009/11/10/asterisk-project-update-astricon-2009/).
