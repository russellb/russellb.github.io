Greetings everyone,

Today, I released a module that allows you to insert static into your phone calls. Are you looking for something to help you get off of annoying phone calls? If so, this module may be for you.

The code is posted for public review and download on the Asterisk project code review site, [reviewboard](http://reviewboard.digium.com/r/214/).

Enjoy!
