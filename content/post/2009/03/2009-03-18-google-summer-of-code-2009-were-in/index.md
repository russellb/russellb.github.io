As originally reported on the [asterisk-dev list](http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2009-March/037307.html), the Asterisk project's application for participation in the Google Summer of Code 2009 has been accepted. Hooray!

For potential students interested in working with us, our ideas list is [here](http://svn.digium.com/view/asterisk/team/group/gsoc-2009/ideas.txt?view=markup), and feel free to contact me directly at russell (AT) digium (DOT) com if you have any questions.
