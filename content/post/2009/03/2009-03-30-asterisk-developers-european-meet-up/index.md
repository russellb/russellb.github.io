\[Note: Please pass this note along to European developers who you may know are not actively scanning the -dev list!\]

The European Asterisk development community may be the largest number of active participants on a per-continent basis, depending on how the measurement is done. There have been a few meetings of Asterisk developers in Europe over the last ten years, but recently there has not been a planned get-together of developers like has been arranged at AstriDevCon (following Astricon) in North America. It is too infrequent that Digium engineering members get to see some of those participants, and also we'd like to encourage the development community by getting everyone together once in a while to meet and talk in a way that is more personable than email, IRC, or by voice alone. Therefore, I'd like to announce that there will be an Asterisk Developer European Meet-Up held in Rostock, Germany on May 2nd and 3rd for the purposes of meeting old friends, introductions to new coders, and getting some good work done towards furthering Asterisk open-source development.

The meeting will be held immediately before AMOOCON on the Saturday/Sunday before the conference. We've been given a room and Internet connectivity for the purposes of having the meet-up, and I suspect there are some good restaurants and bars in the area which might be suitable for post-coding discussion as well.

There is a small group who I've already been in touch with on this, and in order to get a good quorum of developers we'd like to open up the session to a wider audience of development participants. This is really for people who write core Asterisk code - the subjects covered will not be applicable to "user" portions of Asterisk, so please respond only if you're actively writing code within the Asterisk project. If you'd like more general topics, the AMOOCON conference will cover a broader range of VoIP areas. You are encouraged to sign up for the AMOOCON (http://www.amoocon.de/) event which is happening right after the meet-up and is a paid event, but keep in mind the Asterisk Developer European Meet-Up is free to participants. There will be a good handful of attendees from Digium - Kevin, Russell, and perhaps other as-yet-undecided engineering staff, but it's your participation that is what is going to make the meeting productive - we look forward to hearing from you!

Please send your interest to me and I'll add you to the list of attendees.
