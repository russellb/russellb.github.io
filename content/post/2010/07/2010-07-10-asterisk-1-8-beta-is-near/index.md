Asterisk 1.8 will be the next major release of Asterisk with [Long Term Support](http://www.asterisk.org/asterisk-versions). It has been under heavy development for a while now. The first beta release of Asterisk 1.8 will be available by the end of July 2010.

There are many exciting features in Asterisk 1.8. Here are just a couple of the more recent changes that have been merged in:

- **IPv6**: Asterisk 1.8 will have IPv6 support for SIP and RTP.
- **SRTP**: Asterisk 1.8 will have support for secure RTP to allow the media to be encrypted for a SIP call.

The list of new features is quite long. [Take a look](http://svn.digium.com/view/asterisk/trunk/CHANGES?view=markup) for a list of what is in Asterisk trunk (which will soon become Asterisk 1.8).

When Asterisk 1.8 is available as a beta and release candidate, please help by testing things out to help make this the best release yet!
