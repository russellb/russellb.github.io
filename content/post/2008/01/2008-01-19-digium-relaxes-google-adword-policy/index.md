If you heard anything about the recent policy changes made by Digium in regards to the usage of its trademarks with Google AdWords, then be sure you see the official response from our CEO, Danny Windham, on the [Digium blog](http://blogs.digium.com/2008/01/18/digium-relaxes-google-adword-policy/).

From the response:

> Over the past week we have received a number of charged responses regarding the recent change in policy related to the use of Digium trademarked terms in Google AdWords. Some of the responses supported our attempts to better control the use of Digium trademarked terms. Some of the responses disagreed with the policy, but respected Digiumâ€™s right to have changed the policy. Others were from individuals who clearly were unhappy with the change and the process by which it was implemented. We have listened carefully to the feedback, and as a result are relaxing our Google AdWord policy.
