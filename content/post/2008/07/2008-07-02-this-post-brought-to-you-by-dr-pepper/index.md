Working at [Digium](http://www.digium.com) is so random sometimes. This morning, an entire pallet of Dr. Pepper arrived for Kevin P. Fleming, my boss, and the Director of Software Technologies. This pallet held 42 cases of 24 20 oz. bottles each. That's 1008 20 oz. bottles of Dr. Pepper. Furthermore, this arrived with no information on who sent it!

Someone must be very happy with Kevin right now. He made a comment that someone must have really liked his work on [modular echo cancelers](http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/dahdi-commits/2008-June/000049.html) and other fixes and improvements preparing for the first release of DAHDI. :)

Dr. Pepper on the receiving dock, after we had already taken the first 5 cases off of it: ![](images/drpepper2.jpg)

Moving it upstairs to be in the software engineering area ... ![](images/drpepper1.jpg)

The full stack in its final resting place, for now. This stack is two cases deep. Also, there is a row of 6 more cases that can't be seen in this picture. ![](images/drpepper3.jpg)

I sure hope Kevin is willing to share a couple of bottles with the rest of the team!
