[Astricon 2008](http://www.astricon.net) is coming up in a couple of months. I have been to every Astricon in the United States and I always have an amazing time. I spend so much time deep in the trenches of the code that it is really nice to get out and meet people that make good use of Asterisk.

I am currently scheduled to give 2 talks this year. One of them is a "lightning talk", where I will spend 10 to 15 minutes giving a talk titled "Deadlocks explained for the masses". I plan to explain some multi-threaded programming concepts and the causes of deadlocks in a way that all attendees can understand.

My second talk is a joint talk with Kevin Fleming, called "The Asterisk Update - The Present, The Future". Kevin and I will be discussing the current state of Asterisk development, as well as some of our plans for the future direction of the project.

I strongly encourage you to consider attending Astricon, and if you do, come say hello!
