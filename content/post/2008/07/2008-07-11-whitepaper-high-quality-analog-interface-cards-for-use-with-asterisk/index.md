I just came across a whitepaper on analog interface cards via the [Digium twitter feed](http://twitter.com/digium). This paper compares performance of analog cards from Digium, Sangoma, and Rhino.

Check out [the promotion where you can get $100 off your purchase](http://promo.telephonydepot.com/digium/).
