On September 26\-28 in Glendale, Arizona, a group of Asterisk developers will be getting together for three days of hacking, coding, testing, designing and otherwise beating on the Asterisk code base. The event will be hosted at the Renaissance Glendale Hotel and Spa immediately following AstriCon 2008 and will be low-key and open only to serious developers and contributors. We are expecting to keep the attendance to 50 people or less, including many members of the Digium Asterisk development team (currently around 15 people).

If you wish to participate, please contact Kevin P. Fleming so he can make arrangements with you. We will need to have the final list of attendees in place by August 15th or so, so that hotel accommodations can be confirmed. You can find accommodation and travel information on the AstriCon website at [http://www.astricon.net](http://www.astricon.net/).

Each attendee will be responsible for their own travel, meals and lodging costs; the conference sessions will only have a beverage bar and light snacks. There will be free wireless Internet access in the meeting room and in the guest rooms at the Renaissance.

This year we plan to focus our efforts on media stream handling and codec (format) negotiations; at the previous two DevCons we have talked about these topics but not made any significant progress, and it's time to get the work done to improve Asterisk so it can do a better job handling complex media streams and changing codec requirements.

If you are interested in attending, send an email application to kpfleming@digium.com including your name, your involvement with Asterisk (or related projects), and who is sponsoring your attendance (if any company or person is doing so). We will accept applications until August 15th, and then make the decisions about who we can accept based on their level of contribution and the space available at the event.
