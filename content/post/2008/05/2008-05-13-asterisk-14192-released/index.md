This release is related to my [IAX2 performance](http://www.russellbryant.net/blog/index.php/2008/05/05/iax2-performance/) improvements.

\---------------------------

The Asterisk.org development team has released Asterisk version 1.4.19.2.

This release includes some IAX2 channel driver updates. Asterisk 1.4.19.1 was released to address an IAX2 security vulnerability. Unfortunately, the changes to address the security issue had an unfortunate negative impact on IAX2 performance in Asterisk. These issues have been addressed and the related fixes are included in this release. The performance of IAX2 in Asterisk due to these changes should be far better than it was even before the changes were made for the security issue.

Anyone that uses IAX2 should use this release instead of 1.4.19.1.

The release is available for download from the Digium downloads site.
