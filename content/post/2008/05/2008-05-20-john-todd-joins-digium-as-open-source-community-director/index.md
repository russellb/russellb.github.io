I am excited to point out the John Todd has joined Digium as the new Open Source Community Director. John joins us with a vast amount of experience within the Asterisk community and beyond. Without further introduction, I will just point to John's recent message to the development community in [this mailing list post](http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2008-May/033001.html).

Also, see the [Digium press release](http://www.digium.com/en/mediacenter/viewpress/Digium-Strengthens-Ties-to-Community-and-Customer), as well.
