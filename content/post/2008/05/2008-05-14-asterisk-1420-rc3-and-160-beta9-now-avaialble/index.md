The Asterisk.org development team has released Asterisk versions 1.4.20-rc3 and 1.6.0-beta9.

These releases are intended to encourage community testing to improve the quality of the upcoming 1.4.20 and 1.6.0 releases. The testing process has proven extremely useful and we would like to thank everyone who has participated. Please help continue the effort. Any issues with test releases should be reported to [http://bugs.digium.com/](http://bugs.digium.com/) or discussed on the asterisk-dev mailing list.

Both releases are available for download from the Digium downloads site.
