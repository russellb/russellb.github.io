The Asterisk development team has released Asterisk version 1.4.20-rc1.

This release is a release candidate for the upcoming official release of 1.4.20. It contains a large number of bug fixes over the previous release, 1.4.19. We would like to encourage the community to assist us in testing before we release 1.4.20.

The release candidate is available on the download site.
