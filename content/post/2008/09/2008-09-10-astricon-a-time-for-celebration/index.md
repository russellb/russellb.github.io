From the [full post](http://blogs.digium.com/2008/09/09/astricon-a-time-for-celebration/):

> So, after a year of focus on the Asterisk code, Iâ€™m ready to get out and meet up with the Asterisk community. I will be spending as much time as possible in the code zone. I love hearing all of the stories of success and new Asterisk applications that I have never thought of. I get most of my inspiration for what new things to work on from these discussions at Astricon. I want to find great ideas, as well as the people that can help conceptualize and bring them to reality. I hope to see you there, so that I can hear your story, and your ideas, as well.
