Michiel van Baak has just completed some work for Asterisk 1.6 that cleans up a lot of the inconsistencies in the Asterisk CLI command interface. The code is now ready for testing.

See Michiel's post on the [asterisk-dev list](http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2008-February/031846.html).

See the related issue on the [issue tracker](http://bugs.digium.com/view.php?id=8925).
