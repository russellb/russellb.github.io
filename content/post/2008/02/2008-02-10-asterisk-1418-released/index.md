The Asterisk development team has released Asterisk version 1.4.18.

In response to a community request, in preparation for this release, the development community held a release candidate period before making the official release. Multiple people tested it out and reported issues. The release candidate process was definitely a success for this release, and we will continue to do it for future Asterisk 1.4 releases.

To see what changes have been made since the last release, see the ChangeLog here:
