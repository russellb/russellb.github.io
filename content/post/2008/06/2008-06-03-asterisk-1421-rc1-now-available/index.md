The Asterisk development team has released Asterisk version 1.4.21-rc1.

This release is a release candidate for the upcoming official release of 1.4.21. It contains fewer bug fixes than usual for a 1.4 release series update, but some of them are important enough to get the release out sooner. We would like to encourage the community to assist us in testing before we release 1.4.21.

The release candidate is available on the download site.

Please provide release candidate testing feedback to the asterisk-dev mailing list, or the issue tracker, [http://bugs.digium.com/](http://bugs.digium.com).

Thank you for your continued support of Asterisk!
