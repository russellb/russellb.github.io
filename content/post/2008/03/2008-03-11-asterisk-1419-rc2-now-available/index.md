The Asterisk.org development team has released Asterisk 1.4.19-rc2. This is a test release for 1.4.19. The official 1.4.19 release will be made after a 1.4.19 release candidate goes through a few days of testing without finding any major regressions. This release contains one crash regression that was found during testing of 1.4.19-rc1. It also includes a number of other bug fixes, as well.

This release is available for download as a tarball, as well as from svn. Please download and test this release and report any problems to [http://bugs.digium.com/](http://bugs.digium.com).
