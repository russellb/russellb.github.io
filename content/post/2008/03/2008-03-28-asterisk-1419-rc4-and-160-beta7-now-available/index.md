The Asterisk.org development team has released Asterisk versions 1.4.19-rc4 and 1.6.0-beta7.

These releases contain significant bug fixes over the previous pre-releases of 1.4.19 and 1.6.0. We would like to thank everyone for all of the help with pre-release testing. Unless anything new comes up, 1.4.19 will be released at the beginning of next week.

Both releases are available for download from [http://downloads.digium.com/](http://downloads.digium.com).

Thank you for your support!
