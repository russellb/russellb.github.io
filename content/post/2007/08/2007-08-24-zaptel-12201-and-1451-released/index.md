The Asterisk.org development team has announced the release of Zaptel versions 1.2.20.1 and 1.4.5.1. These releases are to correct an error in the install target in the Makefile of the 1.4.5 and 1.2.20 Zaptel releases, as well as a handful of other issues. See the respective Changelogs for more details.

Both releases are available as a tarball as well as a patch against the previous release. They are available for download from downloads.digium.com.

Thank you for your support!
