The Asterisk development team has published a security advisory for a minor security issue related to IMAP storage of voicemail. A properly crafted email in the mailbox that Asterisk tries to open to play voicemail messages can cause the application to crash.

See the [security advisory](http://downloads.digium.com/asa/AST-2007-021.pdf) for details on the issue.
