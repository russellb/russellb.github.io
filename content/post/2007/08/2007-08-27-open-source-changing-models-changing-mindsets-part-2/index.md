[Linux Insider](http://russellbryant.net/blog/wp-admin/Open%20Source:%20Changing%20Models,%20Changing%20Mindsets,%20Part%202) has posted Part 2 of their article on some of the impacts of open source software on the corporate world. There is more discussion of Asterisk in this article.

> The open source Asterisk digital PBX (public branch exchange) platform "is the most interoperable, flexible and feature rich PBX in the market today," asserted Chad Agate, cofounder and CEO of NeoPhonetics.

The article mentions Asterisk's powerful architecture that lets it fit an extremely diverse set of needs in the telecom market.

> Asterisk "allows for transparent switching between all supported interfaces, allowing it to tie together a diverse mixture of telephony systems into a single switching network. It can act as a media gateway for any legacy or VoIP enabled connection available today," Agate explained.
