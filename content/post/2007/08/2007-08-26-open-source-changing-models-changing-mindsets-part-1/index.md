[Linux Insider](http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/9KMRNBq3L8g6gz/Open-Source-Changing-Models-Changing-Mindsets-Part-1.xhtml) has an article on open source software and its impact on the corporate world. It mentions Asterisk for its impact on the traditional telephony market and its use in the corporate world's transition toward the use of VoIP.

> Asterisk-based VoIP applications and appliances have been downloaded by business phone system users more than 4.4 million times, implying millions of users, according to Digium, whose founder, Mark Spencer, started what has grown to become Asterisk's globe-spanning open source project collaboration.

It feels great to have our name up on this list with other influential projects such as the Linux kernel, Firefox, Wikipedia, Apache, and more.
