I have made [a post](http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2007-August/029253.html) to the asterisk-dev mailing list describing a small project I am working on. I am making a way to create application timeouts, scheduled announcements, and periodic announcements that can be used with any Asterisk application.Â  The results of the discussion will determine if this feature goes anywhere or hits the bit bucket.
