The process of developing, releasing, and maintaining Asterisk 1.4 has certainly been a learning experience. I have been putting a lot of thought into the things that we have been dealing with and would like to propose some changes to the way that we manage releases.

Over the past few years we have gone from not having managed releases, to Asterisk 1.0, 1.2, and now 1.4. Over this time period we have transitioned from everyone using the development code directly to now nobody using the development code for any real purpose. This has both been a great thing and a curse at the same time, as I have come to realize.
