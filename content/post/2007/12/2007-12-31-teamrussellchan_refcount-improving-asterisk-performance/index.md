I have a branch that is ready for testing that makes some significant changes to the Asterisk channel handling core.  The changes improve the data structure management for Asterisk channels.  This will provide a large performance benefit.  See the following post to the asterisk-dev mailing list for more information, as well as where to get the code for testing.
