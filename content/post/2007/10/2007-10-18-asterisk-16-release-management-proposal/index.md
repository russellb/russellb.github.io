I have published a document describing the details of the release management for Asterisk 1.6. See the full post to the mailing list [here](http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2007-October/030083.html).

> A few weeks ago, I proposed to this list that we create a new release series that is managed with a short release cycle to introduce smaller sets of new features. I also wanted to increase the emphasis that we put on testing new sets of functionality for potential regressions.
> 
> The feedback on this list was positive, as was all of the feedback I have received directly. I spoke to people about this a lot at Astricon, and received no negative feedback.
> 
> So, I would like to move ahead with formalizing this new release series, Asterisk 1.6. I have documented the new release policy that will apply to this release series, as well as some of the history that inspired these changes to release management.
> 
> I have included the document and would appreciate any feedback from the development community.
