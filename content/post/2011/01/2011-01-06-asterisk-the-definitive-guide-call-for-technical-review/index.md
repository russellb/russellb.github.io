We are finally wrapping up our book, _"Asterisk: The Definitive Guide"_. The contents have been available on a web site for a while, but now that the content is complete, we're looking for a lot of review over the next couple of weeks. We would really appreciate your input!  Here is a post from Leif on the asterisk-doc mailing list from earlier today:

> Hey all!
> 
> We’re getting VERY close to having the first draft of the next Asterisk book, Asterisk: The Definitive Guide ready to be sent off to production. We’re very close to meeting our target dates, but our review timeline is very tight. Only about 2 weeks!
> 
> Each morning we’re continuing to work on the book, taking in your comments, reviewing chapters, testing dialplan and installation steps, and all that good stuff.
> 
> However, we’ve been looking at this book since May 2010 and our eyes are starting to get glazed :) We’d love for the community to have a look at the book and offer some constructive criticism.
> 
> It’s far too late to take requests for things to cover. What we have is what we’re going to get in for this edition. After we finish this book though we plan on continuing to update it, so there will be a chance to take suggestions again soon.
> 
> For now, head on over to [http://ofps.oreilly.com](http://ofps.oreilly.com) and check out the book (updated this morning). There are a couple of bugs in the OFPS software which are causing comments to not be available after chapter 8, but we’re hoping to have those resolved by Friday. However, we do have this fancy mailing list that we can use.

_Update: This issue has been resolved_

> Russell, Jim and myself will be monitoring this list for comments, and we’ll try and get all of them satisfied before publication. If there is a particular area we’re covering that you’re an expert in, we’d love to have you focus on that chapter. You can email me back directly for more information on what we might be looking for in that type of situation.
> 
> We do have editors to help with grammar and spelling, but pointing anything out is certainly useful. The best use of your time though is testing the dialplan snippets, the installation instructions for both Ubuntu and CentOS (we’re covering two Linux distributions this time around, which increases the testing load significantly), and making sure anything we’re explaining is concise, relates to what we’re talking about, and makes sense. The goal is to build an Asterisk system from scratch, so following through our dialplan via the chapters to make sure it all continues to build on itself would be ideal.

> Additionally, if you see any sections which say, “see chapter XXX for more information” that are not links, please let us know, as those are meant to be placeholders until the chapters existed and we could link back to them. Now that all chapters are created, we should be linking to the appropriate locations. If you’re reading a section and notice a good spot to reference another part of the book (for example, lets say we’re talking about database functionality in one of the other chapters, and there is an appropriate spot in the Database Integration chapter to link to), then let us know!

> Thanks for your interest! Books should be shipping sometime between March and April. Pre-orders are available now at [http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517342](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517342). And yes, we’ll be releasing under a Creative Commons license like the last two books, so you’ll have access to the book at any time online.

> This book has been pretty much written from the ground up, and is well over 600 pages of content. It’s been a lot of work, but we hope you like it!
> 
> Thanks! Russell, Jim and Leif.
